        Bautista[11] was born in Washington, D.C.,[12] the son of Donna Raye (née Mullins) and hairdresser David Michael Bautista. His mother is of Greek descent, and his father is the son of Filipino immigrants.[11][13] His paternal grandfather served in the Philippine military, worked as a taxi driver and barber, and held other jobs to feed the family. His mother is a lesbian.[14] Bautista has said that he lived in poverty,[15] and that he had a hard life—before he reached the age of nine, three murders had occurred on his front lawn.[16] As young as age 13, he was stealing cars.[17] By 17, he was estranged from his parents and living on his own.[18] He later said, "I am proud of my parents. They are good, honest, hard-working folks. They taught me the values of working hard."[17]
